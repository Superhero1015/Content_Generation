Hey! Nathan here, with two big new Lex features for you. (You're getting this email because you signed up for Lex , the AI - powered word processor.) To learn about them, watch this video or keep reading. 1. Have the AI write a first draft When you make a new document, you can now have the AI write a first draft, create an outline for you, or just generate a list of topics that are worth considering as you write. It's a great way to get past the blank page! 2. Version history In the top left of the document, you can now click the "Versions" dropdown to save a snapshot of the current document and its comments. You can revisit old versions at any time. This is really handy in a few situations: • When you star t with an outline, save a version before deleting bullet points and turning them into prose. • When you send a draft to people for feedback, save a version before they make edits and leave comments. • When you're going through feedback you've gotten, sav e a version before you start resolving comments and making changes to the document. To use these features today, click here to create a new Lex document (Did you know you can always type "lex.new" into your browser to quickly create a new Lex doc?) One las t thing! Do you like Lex? I'd love to hear your feedback: Click here to fill out a 4 - question survey . Thank you!! Remo ve W atermarkW o n d e r s h a r eP D F e l e m e n t
