Hello! Nathan here, with some good news: You can now use GPT - 4 in Lex! (You're getting this email because you signed up for Lex , the AI - powered word processor. GPT - 4, in case you haven't heard of it, is a new AI model released a few days ago that is a big improvement over previous models.) Try it now at the link I made a short video to show how wildly great it is: A few other nic e things: 1 ChatGPT — In addition to GPT - 4, you can also use ChatGPT 2 Fonts — we now have a couple fonts you can choose from. More coming soon! 3 Creativity — you can control how "creative" the algorithm should be. (More creative means slightly more ra ndom, so it's more likely to make up facts but also more likely to produce interesting, unexpected results.) 4 Improved formatting — there are less formatting errors with AI - generated content now. 5 Command bar works on mobile — there is now a button for it in the header Try it out at the link and let me know what you think! (Or, if you are already logged in and want to skip straight to creating a new doc, use the link ) Remo ve W atermarkW o n d e r s h a r eP D F e l e m e n t
