Hey! Nathan here. Good news: I just shipped a feature in Lex that lets you get feedback from the AI to help improve your writing. (You're getting this email because you signed up for Lex , the AI - powered word processor. I know it's only been a couple of days since I emailed you about something new in Lex — I promise I'll usually keep it to roughly once a week ) As always, here's a quick video that shows how it works: In a nutshell, here's w hat it does: • You click a button • The AI analyzes your writing • It leaves a comment in your document with three (3) ideas for how to improve your intro This is just the beginning. Features like these to make your writing more successful are going to be my main focus over the next few months, if not longer. The big idea is that no matter what you're writing — blog posts, journal entries, sales proposals — Lex should be able to give you helpful feedback that increases your chances of success. When we sit do wn to write, it costs time and energy. There is always some goal that we have in mind. Lex's job is to help you achieve that goal. Of course, right now it's barely scratching the surface. But I'm excited to see how far we can push the technology together t o make an entirely new kind of writing tool. Try the "get feedback on your writing" feature today at the link! I would love to hear what you think! And if you have any ideas for how I can make it better, I would love to hear those too. Thanks so much! — Nat han Remo ve W atermarkW o n d e r s h a r eP D F e l e m e n t
